/**
 * The class that reduces complex code snippets for selecting a file or directory using JFileChooser to a few
 * lines of code. It is created in order to reduce the complexity that may be caused by the long
 * and repeating code snippet that could be used for selecting a file or a directory using JFileChooser.
 * Simply call <pre>{@code loadFileTo(String targetDir, int mode)}</pre> and the selected file or directory is
 * copied to the desired path. <pre></pre>
 * In order to make sure that the program doesn't try to process a null file or directory
 * as the user clicks Cancel, don't forget to check if the attribute <strong>filename</strong> is null.
 * Use the copied file or directory in your code only if <strong>filename is not null</strong>.
 * <pre>
 *     <strong>Ex:</strong>
 *     {@code if(FileOperations.filename != null){
 *         //Process the file here.
 *     }}
